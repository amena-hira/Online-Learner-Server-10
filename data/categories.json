      "details": "Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc).The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects."
